# CoLight: Cooperative Light Signal Optimization via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project implements a multi-agent reinforcement learning system to optimize traffic light patterns in a simulated city grid, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow efficiency through cooperative learning.

## Setup
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install SUMO traffic simulator
3. Set up environment variables

## Project Structure
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `data/`: Data files and SUMO networks
- `src/`: Source code
- `experiments/`: Training and evaluation scripts
- `notebooks/`: Analysis notebooks
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Running the Project
1. Training: `python experiments/train.py`
2. Evaluation: `python experiments/evaluate.py`
